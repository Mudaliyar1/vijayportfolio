# Using GitHub's "Allow Secret" Option

If you want to quickly resolve the GitHub push protection issue, you can use the "Allow Secret" option:

1. Go to the URL provided by GitHub in the error message
2. Click on "I understand, allow this secret"
3. Try pushing your code again

**Important Security Note:**
After allowing the push, you should:
1. Revoke the exposed token immediately
2. Create a new token to replace it
3. Update your .env file with the new token
4. Never commit the .env file to your repository

This approach is quick but less secure than creating a new clean repository.
