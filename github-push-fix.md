# Fixing GitHub Push Protection Issues

GitHub has detected a sensitive token in your commit history. Here are three ways to resolve this issue:

## Option 1: Allow the Secret (Quickest but Less Secure)

Follow the URL provided by GitHub to allow the secret. This will tell GitHub that you acknowledge the secret and want to push anyway.

## Option 2: Create a New Repository (Most Secure)

If you want to completely remove the token from your history:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Push only your current code (not the history) to the new repository:

```bash
# Create a new directory for the clean repository
mkdir clean-portfolio
cd clean-portfolio

# Initialize a new git repository
git init

# Copy all files from your current repository (except .git folder)
cp -r ../vijayportfolio/* .
cp ../vijayportfolio/.env.example .
cp ../vijayportfolio/.gitignore .

# Add all files to the new repository
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit with clean history"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Mudaliyar1/new-portfolio-name.git

# Push to the new repository
git push -u origin main
```

This creates a completely new repository without any history of the sensitive token.

## Option 3: Use BFG Repo-Cleaner (Advanced)

If you want to keep your repository history but remove the token:

1. Install BFG Repo-Cleaner: https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/
2. Create a file called `replacements.txt` with the token to replace (without showing the actual token)
3. Run BFG to replace the token in history

## Important Note

Remember to revoke any exposed tokens and create new ones, as the old ones should be considered compromised.
