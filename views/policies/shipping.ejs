    <p class="mb-4">FTRAISE AI primarily provides digital services, including AI-powered Digital Twins, Neural Dreamscape visualization, website building, and other AI-enhanced features. As these are digital services delivered electronically through our platform at <a href="/" class="text-neon-blue hover:text-neon-purple transition-colors">https://ftraiseai.onrender.com/</a>, traditional shipping does not apply to our core offerings.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">This policy outlines how we deliver our digital services and any potential physical products that may be offered in the future.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Digital Delivery</h2>
