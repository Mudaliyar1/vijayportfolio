    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Digital Services</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">FTRAISE AI primarily provides digital services, including AI-powered website building, hosting, and related digital products. As these are digital services delivered electronically, traditional shipping does not apply to our core offerings.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">2.2. <strong>Delivery Timeframe:</strong> For standard website generation services, delivery is typically immediate or within 24 hours of payment confirmation. For custom services requiring additional work, delivery timeframes will be communicated during the ordering process.</p>
