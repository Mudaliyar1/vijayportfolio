      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What are cookies?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
        They contain information that is transferred to your device and allow the website to remember your actions and preferences over a period of time.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work more efficiently, provide essential functionality,
        enhance user experience, and collect analytics data that helps improve site performance and content relevance.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, FTRAISE AI) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set
        by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party
        features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content and analytics).

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We use cookies for several specific purposes that help us deliver a secure, personalized experience. Our cookie usage falls into the following categories:

          <strong class="text-neon-blue">Performance/Analytics Cookies:</strong> These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website
          by collecting and reporting information anonymously. This data allows us to improve the way our website works and optimize user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="text-neon-blue">Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies enable enhanced functionality and personalization.
