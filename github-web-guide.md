# Creating a New Clean Repository Using GitHub Web Interface

If you're not comfortable with command-line tools, you can use the GitHub web interface to create a new clean repository:

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter a name for your new repository
3. Choose whether it should be public or private
4. Do NOT initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Upload Your Current Code
1. On the new repository page, click on "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop all your files (except the .git folder) into the upload area
3. Add a commit message like "Initial commit with clean code"
4. Click "Commit changes"

## Step 3: Update Your Local Repository
1. Clone the new repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mudaliyar1/your-new-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Copy your .env file to the new repository (this file should not be in GitHub)
3. Continue working with the new clean repository

## Important Security Note
Remember to:
1. Revoke any exposed tokens
2. Create new tokens to replace them
3. Update your .env file with the new tokens
4. Never commit the .env file to your repository
