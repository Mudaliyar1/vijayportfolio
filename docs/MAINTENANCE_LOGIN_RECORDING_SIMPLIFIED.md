# Maintenance Login Recording Simplified

This document explains the simplified approach to recording login attempts during maintenance mode, addressing the issue where login attempts weren't being properly recorded due to missing dependencies.

## The Issue

When users tried to log in during maintenance mode, we encountered errors because the code was trying to use the `express-useragent` package which wasn't installed. This prevented login attempts from being properly recorded in the database.

## Root Cause

The code was depending on external packages (`express-useragent` and `device-detector-js`) to parse user agent information, but these packages weren't installed or properly imported in all the necessary files.

## Changes Made

1. **Installed Missing Package**:
   - Added the `express-useragent` package to the project dependencies

2. **Simplified Login Attempt Recording**:
   - Removed dependency on complex user agent parsing
   - Used a simplified approach to record login attempts with basic information
   - Ensured that timestamps are properly set for all login attempts

3. **Updated All Login Recording Code**:
   - Updated the code in both the user controller and maintenance controller
   - Used consistent approach across all login attempt recording functions
   - Improved error handling to prevent failures when recording login attempts

## How It Works Now

1. **When a Non-Admin User Tries to Log In During Maintenance**:
   - The authentication process completes successfully
   - Before logging them out, we record their login attempt with simplified information
   - The login attempt includes basic information about the user, their IP address, and timestamp
   - No complex user agent parsing is performed, reducing the chance of errors

2. **When an Already Logged-In Non-Admin User Tries to Access a Page During Maintenance**:
   - The maintenance middleware detects that they're not an admin
   - Before logging them out, we record their access attempt with simplified information
   - The same basic information is recorded

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Enable Maintenance Mode**:
   - Go to Admin > Maintenance Management
   - Set Maintenance Mode to "Enabled"
   - Save the settings

2. **Try to Log In**:
   - Open a new browser or incognito window
   - Try to log in with a non-admin account
   - You should be redirected to the maintenance page with a message
   - The login attempt should be recorded without errors

3. **Check the Maintenance Page**:
   - Log in with an admin account
   - Go to Admin > Maintenance Management
   - The login attempt should appear in the "Login Attempts During Maintenance" section

## Troubleshooting

If login attempts still don't appear:

1. **Check the Server Logs**:
   - Look for "Logged maintenance login attempt:" messages
   - Verify that there are no errors related to recording login attempts

2. **Check the Database**:
   - Verify that the MaintenanceLoginAttempt collection contains the new records
   - Check that the timestamps are correct and recent

3. **Restart the Server**:
   - Sometimes a server restart is needed after installing new packages
   - Make sure the server is running with the latest code changes
