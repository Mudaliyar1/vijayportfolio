# Maintenance Login Recording Fix

This document explains the fixes applied to the maintenance login recording functionality, addressing the issue where login attempts weren't being properly recorded in the database during maintenance mode.

## The Issue

When users tried to log in during maintenance mode, their login attempts were being logged in the server console but weren't showing up in the maintenance page. This was happening because:

1. The login attempts weren't being properly recorded in the database
2. There was an issue with the timestamp of the login attempts
3. The login recording logic was only in the maintenance middleware but not in the authentication flow

## Root Cause

The main issue was that when a user successfully authenticated but was then logged out due to maintenance mode, we weren't recording this login attempt in the database. The login attempt recording logic was only in the maintenance middleware for direct login attempts, but not in the authentication success handler.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated the User Controller**:
   - Added login attempt recording logic in the authentication success handler
   - Ensured that when a non-admin user successfully logs in during maintenance mode, their attempt is recorded before they're logged out
   - Added proper timestamp to ensure the login attempt is associated with the current maintenance period

2. **Updated the Maintenance Middleware**:
   - Added login attempt recording logic for users who are already logged in but try to access pages during maintenance
   - Ensured that these attempts are also recorded with the correct timestamp

## How It Works Now

1. **When a Non-Admin User Tries to Log In During Maintenance**:
   - The authentication process completes successfully
   - Before logging them out, we record their login attempt in the database
   - The login attempt includes detailed information about the user, their device, browser, and IP address
   - The timestamp is set to the current time to ensure it's associated with the current maintenance period

2. **When an Already Logged-In Non-Admin User Tries to Access a Page During Maintenance**:
   - The maintenance middleware detects that they're not an admin
   - Before logging them out, we record their access attempt in the database
   - The access attempt includes the same detailed information as a login attempt
   - The timestamp is set to the current time

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Enable Maintenance Mode**:
   - Go to Admin > Maintenance Management
   - Set Maintenance Mode to "Enabled"
   - Save the settings

2. **Try to Log In**:
   - Open a new browser or incognito window
   - Try to log in with a non-admin account
   - You should be redirected to the maintenance page with a message
   - The login attempt should be recorded

3. **Check the Maintenance Page**:
   - Log in with an admin account
   - Go to Admin > Maintenance Management
   - The login attempt should appear in the "Login Attempts During Maintenance" section

## Troubleshooting

If login attempts still don't appear:

1. **Check the Server Logs**:
   - Look for "Recorded maintenance login attempt for:" messages
   - Verify that the login attempts are being recorded

2. **Check the Database**:
   - Verify that the MaintenanceLoginAttempt collection contains the new records
   - Check that the timestamps are correct and recent

3. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Clear your browser cache and reload the page
   - This ensures you're seeing the latest data
