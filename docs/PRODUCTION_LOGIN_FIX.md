# Production Login Fix

This document provides instructions for fixing login issues in the production environment where users remain on the login page or still see login/register options even after successfully logging in.

## The Issue

In production environments, the session cookie settings may cause authentication state to not persist properly, resulting in users appearing logged out even after successful authentication.

## Solution

We've implemented several fixes to address this issue:

1. Updated session configuration in `server.js`
2. Enhanced session error handling in `middleware/sessionErrorHandler.js`
3. Improved login process in `controllers/userController.js`
4. Added more robust user checks in `views/partials/navbar.ejs`
5. Created a script to update environment variables for production

## Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy the fix:

1. **Update Environment Variables**

   Run the update-env.js script to ensure the SECURE_COOKIES environment variable is set:

   ```
   node scripts/update-env.js
   ```

   This will add `SECURE_COOKIES=false` to your .env file if it doesn't exist.

2. **Clear Existing Sessions**

   If you're experiencing issues with existing sessions, you can clear them:

   ```
   node scripts/clear-sessions.js
   ```

3. **Restart Your Application**

   Restart your application to apply the changes:

   ```
   # If using PM2
   pm2 restart your-app-name

   # If using systemd
   sudo systemctl restart your-service-name
   ```

4. **Verify the Fix**

   - Try logging in with a test account
   - Verify that you remain logged in when navigating between pages
   - Check that the login/register buttons are replaced with your username after login

## Technical Details

### Session Configuration Changes

We've updated the session configuration with the following improvements:

- Added `sameSite: 'lax'` to improve cookie security and compatibility
- Made `secure` cookie setting conditional based on HTTPS configuration
- Added explicit `path: '/'` to ensure the cookie is available throughout the site
- Added proper session serialization and deserialization functions

### Session Error Handling

The enhanced session error handler now:

- Provides more detailed logging for debugging session issues
- Detects and fixes inconsistent authentication states
- Forces logout and redirect when session corruption is detected

### Login Process Improvements

The login process now:

- Logs additional information for debugging
- Explicitly saves the session before redirecting
- Ensures the authentication state is properly persisted

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience login issues after deploying these fixes:

1. **Check Browser Console**

   Look for any JavaScript errors or cookie-related warnings in the browser console.

2. **Inspect Cookies**

   - Open browser developer tools
   - Go to the Application/Storage tab
   - Check if the `connect.sid` cookie is being set correctly

3. **Check Server Logs**

   Look for any session-related errors in your server logs.

4. **Try Different Browsers**

   Some issues may be browser-specific due to cookie policies.

5. **Clear Browser Cookies**

   Have users clear their browser cookies and try logging in again.
